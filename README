SCAF DEV INSTRUCTIONS:

Repository contains only bare autotools inputs. Run the following to generate standard configure/Makefile stuff:

autoreconf --install

NOTE: This implementation of scaf requires zeromq. If it is not in a standard place, you can specify its location to configure:
./configure ... --with-zeromq=/opt/ ...

Then run this to build a source tarball to distribute:
make dist

Of course, you can also do the standard ./configure && make install.
